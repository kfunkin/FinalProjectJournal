          <h3>Final Project Week 3 Journal</h3>
          <p>I find the current state of digital music consumption rather uninspiring.
          A bunch of files stored on a device, with just cover artwork. I hope to
          explore the concept of album apps, a concept that generally hasn't been
          adopted by the music industry. As an outsider looking in, I can't see why
          it hasn't taken off as initially predicted. There have been successful apps
          as albums, Bjork's Biophilia being an excellent example. Whilst my novice
          programming skill-set won't afford me the scope of such an app, I hope to
          produce something that will perhaps keep the listener entertained, in the
          same way as a listener would consume the artwork on a gatefold vinyl.
          Although not a new or groundbreaking concept, I hope this exploration will
          provide an insight into the potential of the platform to release music.
          Perhaps it could be used as a platform to house all releases by an artist,
          albums, EPs or singles could be released as in-app purchases, stored in
          an app on your device, like a section of a shelf housing your cd or vinyl
          collection by a particular artist, in chronological order. Music has always
          embraced the visual, so why should digitally downloaded music be so dull in
          comparison to its predecessors? The convenience of digitally downloaded
          music should not come at the cost of visual appeal, as it seems to currently,
          surely there's room for both?  </P>

          <h4>Research</h4>
          <p> I'm interested in the concept of the Suspension of Disbelief in music.
          It could be argued that this concept applies to my project as my characters
          Marat and Yaroslav could be seen as alter egos, Marat is a fictional bass player
          in a fictional band with his friend Yaroslav, a fictional drummer in the fictional
          band 'French Fries'. I'm a bass player who likes to make music in my spare time
          with my friend who is a drummer, which is where my original idea came from.
          Of course, this isn't a new concept, David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust springs to mind
          as a successful alter ego releasing music. Another excellent example and perhaps
          more relevent is Gorillaz - Damon Albarn's other band consisting of animated
          characters illustrated by Jamie Hewlett. Narrative frames music, it seems in
          other areas of the arts, music frames narrative.</p>

          <p> I've looked into various JavaScript animation libraries and found AnimeJS quite
          straight forward to use. As a test I've pieced together a scene using HTML/CSS.
          The process consisted of: cut out imagery from Kays catalogue to piece with
          character's heads, then print off bodies, heads and typographical elements onto
          inkjet acetates before cutting out with a scalpel. I then scanned the cut out acetates
          before placing them into my HTML file. From there I composed the scene using CSS, before
          using JavaScript to grab the elements to animate. I'm quite happy with the results, however,
          after a discussion with my tutor, I'd like to be able to complete the task without the
          need for a JS library. For what I want to achieve, surely plain Vanilla JS will do?
