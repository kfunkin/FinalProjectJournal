        <h3>Final Project Week 2 Journal</h3>
        <p>My final project is going to be an app album which includes an artwork viewer and
        an interactive story featuring Marat & Yarolslav, founders of Russian funk outfit
        ‘French Fries’. This is an extension of my Individual Design project where the
        characters Marat and Yaroslav were first created.

        The idea for this project came from research during the Individual Design module,
        which got me thinking about the concept of app as album. </p>
        <h4>Development:</h4>
        <p>I’ve started developing the visual style and concept for the interactive novel/short story,
        of which I’m pleased with so far. I’ve managed to place the basic artwork into an HTML file
        and with the use of Impress.js, I’ve made basic transitions from section to section, which
        would work well for an interactive graphic novel. I’d like to develop the graphic style further,
        using acetates which would be layered to create the overall image. I'd like to then animate each
        acetate (PNG file) in JavaScript.</P>


        <p>I’ve identified a few JavaScript libraries that I could possibly use: Three.js, Pixi.js and
        Popmotion.js. So far Popmotion looks the easiest to implement.

        It includes a drag feature which I’m interested in exploring as I’d like the artwork in the
        artwork viewer to be able to be moved around by the user, thus creating their own version of
        the album artwork.  </p>


        <p>I’ve found some great examples of JavaScript animation using Three.js and Pixi.js:</p>



        <h5>Because Recollection - Because<a href="http://because-recollection.com/"> View it here </a></h5>


        <p>A collection of interactive music content from various acts on the French label Because, made with Pixi.js.
        It seems their acts and indeed the label themselves have embraced the idea of interactive music, I wonder
        if they’ve released an album as an app? I’ll find out soon enough with further research.</p>

        <p>Made with Pixi.js, there's also a blog from the person who made it, which could prove insightful.</p>

        <p>Beautiful animation using Pixi.js.</p>





        <h5>VeilHymn

          <a href="http://www.veilhymn.com/">View it here</a></h5>

        <p>An interactive music video using Three.js that lets the user see behind the scenes of the shooting of the video by pressing and holding on the screen to reveal glitchy animation leading to the behind the scenes footage, all in sync with the audio of the music video. If only the song was as edgy as the aesthetic, a little sugary for my palette. </p>
