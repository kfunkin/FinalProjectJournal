          <h4>Research</h4>
          <p> I've further explored the concept of Suspension of Disbelief in music this week and came across
            an interesting essay entitled <i>Torpedoing the Authorship of Popular Music: A Reading of Gorillaz'
            'Feel Good Inc.'</i> by Lars Eckstein. In it, Eckstein explains how the Gorillaz project has enabled
            Albarn (of indie-pop hitmakers <i>Blur</i>) to '(re)gain artistic and political agency as a songwriter
            while strictly working within the rigid commercial logic of the major label music industry'.

            <blockquote> Taking it's cue from the recent flooding of the pop market with manufactured boy or girl groups,
            the Gorillaz project thus creatively radicalises the synthetic assembling of marketable media images and
            takes full fictional licence to 'make the ultimate manufactured band'
            At the same time, however, the boundaries between between authors, mundane performers and fictional
            characters are deliberately blurred. Thus, the band members are clearly modelled on the core of those
            flesh and blood performers who have created and recorded Gorillaz' sounds in the real world. They are,
            in a way, fictionalised caricatures of their real live models: 2D physically resembles Damon Albarn
            and obviously sings with Albarn's voice, Murdoc is inspired by Jamie Hewlett, Russell is modelled on
            Ice Cube's cousin Del Tha Funky Homosapien, while Miho Hatori of the New York independent group Cibo Matto
            backs up Noodle. In a simulacrous way, 2D, Murdoc, Russell and Noodle are thus independent characters
            with idiosyncratic fictional biographies, but at the same time also function as signs representing
            real life artists.

            </blockquote>

            And that, it could be argued, is the <i> human interest with a semblance of truth</i> that Coleridge defines
            as a key element to suspend one's disbelief.
            The essay and indeed <i>Gorillaz</i> provides an avenue to explore further into the Suspension of Disbelief in music
            in the modern era, where it's not just about the music, it's how the music is presented (framed),
            in this case framed with a multi-media narrative.
