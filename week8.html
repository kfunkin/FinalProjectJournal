      <h3>Final Project Week 8 Journal</h3>
<div id="paragraph1w8">
      <p>This week I started to piece together the storyboards for the interactive story. So far I've sketched out
        eight frames and have begun putting them together with CSS. I'm happy with the result so far, the aesthetic
        is coming together nicely. I think the acetates scanned in work really well. The ink doesn't quite settle
        on the surface of the acetate, their imperfections creating the feel I'm looking for.</p>
        <h4>New band member! Alexei on keys!</h4>
        <p> The band have brought in sought after session keyboardist Alexei to help mould the Baltic Funk sound.
          He brings with him a wealth of experience, a session legend in Russia, he's appeared on countless Russian
          pop hits. He's also worked as a male model in the UK for Kays catalogue, the handsome brute!

      <p><h4>Sprint Goal</h4>
        For the end of this sprint I'm aiming to have a pinch zoom implemented into the album view, so the
        user can zoom in and out of the album artwork. I've found a JS library called <i>PinchZoomJS</i>, fingers
        crossed I get it working. After that I need to look at the anchor points of my draggable objects, during
        user testing I (and the person who tested the prototype) found that the objects are anchored to the left,
        when they need to be centred, for a better experience.

      <p><h4>Pinch Zoom JS</h4>
        It's not quite there yet but it's progress. I need to make my imagery smaller and also have a play with
        the CSS. Nearly there!
