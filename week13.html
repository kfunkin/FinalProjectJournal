          <p>I've started putting together the world in which the band will ocupy in the interactive story.
          Before I could make informed image choices I had to nail down a script. Probably the least enjoyable
          part of the project up to now, it seemed to take too long to put it together. I was recommended a book
          to aid this surprisingly difficult task. The book is called 'How To Write A Movie in 21 Days' by Viki
          King. In it, the author explains how to get the ideas onto paper before planning out key moments using
          index cards, after this it's a case of joining the dots in between the key points.

          <h7><mark>Scenery</mark><h7>
          <p>After the bulk of the story was formulated I set out to create the scenery. The visual
          style for the interactive story was created quite a while back and is prevalent in the later pages
          of this journal. The process starts with an image, for example a building. The image will then be clipped
          out in Photoshop, before being printed onto acetate. Once printed, the image is then cut out with a ruler
          and scalpel and then scanned. The scanned image is then opened in Photoshop and clipped out before being
          saved as a PNG.

          <h7><mark>New characters</mark><h7>
            <p>The formulation of the script also gave birth to new characters for the story, a bunch of bands that
              were associated with our main characters during their heyday, at the height of the Baltic Funk Movement.</p>
