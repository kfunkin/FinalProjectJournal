          <h3>Week 9</h3>
            <p> This week I've continued to look into the pinch-zoom function. I didn't have the success
                I hoped for with Pinch-ZoomJS. Rather than sticking with it I panicked and started looking for
                other JS libraries that could help me implement the pinch-zoom function I'm after.
                I looked at <i>HammerJS</i> and <i>ZoomJS</i>. Again I panicked and swerved away from <i>HammerJS</i>
                when it wasn't going my way and moved on to <i>ZoomJS</i>. ZoomJS seemed to work, but was perhaps
                the most inferior of the three libraries I've looked at. After a discussion with my tutor it was decided that
                I should persevere with <i>PinchZoomJS</i>, after all, if people before me have made it work, then
                there's no reason why I can't. </p>
                <h6><mark>UI Frameworks</mark></h6>
                  This week I've also started looking into UI frameworks to help me put together the UI elements of
                  the project. I've been told that <i>Bootstrap</i> has a good grid system, which will come in handy
                  to make elements fully responsive. Whilst exploring <i>Bootstrap</i> I thought it would be a good idea
                  to piece together some storyboards. This also led me to look at the typography for the interactive
                  story (see above 'this groove is cold man!'). This was achieved by cutting up printed out lettering then sticking
                  back together with sticky tape, before scanning in. Then the imagery was adjusted in Photoshop before
                  being made into a vector in Illustrator before being saved as SVG. </p>
